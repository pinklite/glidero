# General Contributing Guidelines

The Memo contributing policies and procedures can be found in the
main Memo documentation repositoryâ€™s [contributing page](https://github.com/uon-projects/glidero/blob/CONTRIBUTING.md).

To make a contribution, you'll need to be able to build the library from source
and run our tests.

## Code Conventions

Since we all want to spend more time coding and less time fiddling with
whitespace, Memo uses code conventions and styles to
encourage consistency. Code with a consistent style is easier (and less
error-prone!) to review, maintain, and understand.

#### Be consistent

If the style guide is not explicit about a particular situation, the cardinal
rule is to **be consistent**. For example, take a look at the surrounding code
and follow its lead, or look for similar cases elsewhere in the codebase.
